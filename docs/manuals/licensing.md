## Guidelines for repositories containing code

Each repository should include a licence file. This should be called `LICENSE`. "License" is the US English spelling.

GitHub will still show licence details for the British English spelling, but we use the American
spelling for standardisation reasons.

You should specify the licence and link to it in the repository's README. It is typical to include
this information at the very end of a README under a 'Licence' heading.

### Use MIT

For open source projects, we use the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Make sure the licence content is included in full, including the title "The MIT License", so that
readers are quickly able to see what licence is being used.

### Copyright Notice

For example, `Copyright (c) Elliott Mozley (trading as Zenworks)`

The year should be the year the code was first published. Where the code is continually updated with significant changes, you can show the year as a period from first to most recent update, for example 2015-2019.

!!! tip ""
		Once Zenworks is registered, this needs to be changed immediately so that copyright is
		under Zenworks, not Elliott Mozley (trading as Zenworks)
